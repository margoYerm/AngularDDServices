# Installation pre-requisites

IMPORTANT: Please use Node 18 (Long Term Support version). Note that Node 18 is not yet officially supported by the Angular CLI.

# Installing the Angular CLI

    npm install -g @angular/cli


# How To install this repository

    npm install


# To Run the Development Backend Server

In order to be able to provide realistic examples, we will need in our playground a small REST API backend server. We can start the sample application backend with the following command:

    npm run server

This is a small Node REST API server.

# To run the Development UI Server

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start

The application is visible at port 4200: [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)



# Important

This repository has multiple branches, have a look at the beginning of each section to see the name of the branch.

At certain points along the course, you will be asked to checkout other remote branches other than master. You can view all branches that you have available remotely using the following command:

    git branch -a

  The remote branches have their starting in origin, such as for example 1-navigation-and-containers.

We can checkout the remote branch and start tracking it with a local branch that has the same name, by using the following command:

      git checkout -b section-1 origin/1-navigation-and-containers

It's also possible to download a ZIP file for a given branch,  using the branch dropdown on this page on the top left, and then selecting the Clone or Download / Download as ZIP button.
